    "The goal of this work is to analyze data in order to provide a model that will predict the severity of an accident, given a number of features that will be extracted from the car collision data from Seattle. The model will classify and predict severity, so a driver can use this model through a third-party or government app to change course or drive more carefully, given that he is not wanting to get involved into an accident.\n",

    "This project will use Machine Learning to build models to predict the severity of the car accidents according to the external factors in the car collision data of the city of Seattle. This model can be applied to multiple practical conditions, such as route planning, signals placement or road improvements. This model can be methodologically extrapolated to other cities anywhere in the world that have similar data collection systems.\n",
